# This is my attempt at coding the dice-rolling component of the Monopoly board game. I'm trying to teach myself Python, and I thought this would be a good challenge...and so far it is...kicking my butt. Right now I'm having an issue with the if statement when rolling a double. More specifically, when a double is rolled, it's expected that the player that rolled the double to roll again. But when the dice are rolled again, it's by the next player who essentially steals the previous player's turn.

import random

players = ["PLAYER ONE", "PLAYER TWO", "PLAYER THREE", "PLAYER FOUR"]
doubles = []

while True:
	for player in players:
        roll_dice = input("Roll? ")  # Asks user for input.
        dice_one = random.randint(1, 6)  # Randomizes the number "rolled" between 1 and 6.
        dice_two = random.randint(1, 6)  # Randomizes the number "rolled" between 1 and 6.
        roll_sum = dice_one + dice_two  # Adds the values of dice_one and dice_two.
        doubles_rolled = doubles.__len__() + 1  # When printed, shows the starting value as 1 not 0.
        doubles.append(1)  # Appends 1 to the list's number of values.

        if dice_one == dice_two and doubles.__len__() < 3:  # Runs if dice_one and dice_two match and if doubles is less than 3.
            print("\nDoubles rolled: " + str(doubles_rolled))
            print("{0} rolled doubles with {1}s. ".format(player, dice_one))
            print("Move token {0} spaces and roll again. <1>".format(roll_sum))

        elif doubles.__len__() == 3:  # Runs if the length of doubles gets to 3.
            print("\nDoubles rolled: " + str(doubles_rolled))
            print("{0} has rolled [{1}s] doubles 3 times in a row and must now go to jail. ".format(player, dice_one))
            print("Do NOT pass GO. Do NOT collect $200! It's the next player's turn. <2>")
            doubles.clear()  # Clears the contents of the doubles list.

        else:  # For when the player doesn't roll a double.
            print("\n{0} rolled a {1} and {2}. ".format(player, dice_one, dice_two))
            print("Move token {0} spaces. ".format(roll_sum))
            print("It's the next player's turn. <3>")
            doubles.clear()  # Clears the contents of the doubles list.
